# Mako Autoclicker

A lightweight autoclicker application for Windows with both mouse and keyboard support. Built with SDL2 and ImGui.

## Quick Start (Pre-built Release)

1. Download the latest release from the [releases](https://github.com/Nimplex/MakoClicker/releases/) page
2. Extract the archive to your desired location
3. Run `Mako.exe`

## Building from Source

### Requirements

* Windows 10 or later (64-bit)
* Visual Studio 2019 or later (recommended) â€” includes MSVC compiler and C++ toolchain
  *(Alternatively, you can use other C++ compilers compatible with CMake, but Visual Studio is recommended for ease of use)*
* CMake 3.16 or higher
* Git (for fetching dependencies)

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Nimplex/MakoClicker
cd MakoClicker
```

### 2. Fetch Dependencies

Run the dependency script to automatically download ImGui and SDL2:

```bash
scripts/fetch_dependencies.bat
```

This will create an `external/` directory and clone the required libraries.

### 3. Build the Application

Use the build script for a quick Release build:

```bash
scripts/build.bat
```

Or build manually with CMake:

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..
cmake --build . --config Release
```

The executable will be created in `build/Release/Mako.exe`.
